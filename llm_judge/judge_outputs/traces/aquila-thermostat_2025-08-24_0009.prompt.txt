SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
Hardware:
Aquila uses a brushless DC fan and supports 24VAC systems with C-wire. 
It operates between -10°C and 50°C, and measures humidity with ±2% accuracy.
The e-ink display updates once per minute to save power.

Safety:
Aquila includes a thermal cutoff at 90°C and fails closed to protect compressors.
If the humidity sensor fails, Aquila logs a diagnostic code H-SNS and continues heating/cooling using temperature only.

RESPONSE:
Coldline requires a 60-day minimum storage duration.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. Coldline requires a 60-day minimum storage duration.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
