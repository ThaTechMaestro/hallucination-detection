SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
System:
Orion Home Hub is a local automation controller with edge ML routines.
It runs OrionOS 7 and supports plug-ins written in TypeScript. 
A quad-core ARM CPU with 2 GB RAM handles up to 200 devices.

Protocols:
Supports Matter 1.2, Zigbee 3.0, and Z‑Wave Plus. Thread networking is available via a built-in border router.
No proprietary RF protocols are supported.

Automation:
Rules engine supports triggers, conditions, and actions with priority scheduling.
Scene activation executes actions in parallel; a scene timeout can be configured from 1–30 seconds.

RESPONSE:
Vela Pro does not support wireless charging pads, and the case includes a 10W Qi coil for emergencies.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. Vela Pro does not support wireless charging pads, and the case includes a 10W Qi coil for emergencies.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
