SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
Connectivity:
Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint for two devices. Low-latency mode reduces end-to-end audio delay to ~120 ms.
Pairing requires the lid open and the button held for 3 seconds until the LED flashes white.

Water & Warranty:
IPX5 water resistance for the earbuds (case is not water resistant). 
Warranty is 12 months limited; battery capacity loss over time is expected and not covered unless below 70% within 6 months.

Audio:
Vela Pro supports AAC and SBC codecs. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) has three levels.
Transparency mode amplifies speech frequencies between 1â€“3 kHz. Dual MEMS mics in each bud.

RESPONSE:
Low-latency mode reduces audio delay to about 120 ms.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. Low-latency mode reduces audio delay to about 120 ms.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
