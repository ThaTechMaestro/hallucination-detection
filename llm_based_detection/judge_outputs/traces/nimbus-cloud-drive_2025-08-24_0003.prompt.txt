SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
Overview:
Nimbus Cloud Drive is a multi-tenant object storage service for unstructured data.
Buckets are regional and immutable once created in a region. Each bucket has a globally unique name.
Standard storage class offers 99.95% monthly availability and 11 nines durability.
Coldline storage requires a minimum 30-day storage duration.

Data movement:
Cross-region replication is asynchronous with an RPO of under 15 minutes under normal conditions.
Lifecycle rules can transition objects between Standard, Infrequent Access, and Coldline.
Lifecycle transitions execute once per day at approximately 00:00 UTC.

RESPONSE:
Coldline requires a 60-day minimum storage duration.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. Coldline requires a 60-day minimum storage duration.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
