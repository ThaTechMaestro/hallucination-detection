SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
Audio:
Vela Pro supports AAC and SBC codecs. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) has three levels.
Transparency mode amplifies speech frequencies between 1–3 kHz. Dual MEMS mics in each bud.

Battery & Charging:

The case provides three full recharges. USB‑C wired charging only; no wireless charging pad support.

Connectivity:

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. Nimbus Cloud Drive uses AES-256 server-side encryption by default.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
