SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
Overview:
Nimbus Cloud Drive is a multi-tenant object storage service for unstructured data.
Buckets are regional and immutable once created in a region. Each bucket has a globally unique name.
Standard storage class offers 99.95% monthly availability and 11 nines durability.
Coldline storage requires a minimum 30-day storage duration.

Billing:
Requests are billed per 1,000 operations. Data egress to the public internet incurs fees.
Intra-region egress between Nimbus services is free. Deleting objects in Coldline before 30 days triggers early deletion fees.

API:
The ListObjects API paginates using opaque continuation tokens. 
Single request limits: 1,000 objects per page or 32 MB response size, whichever is reached first.
Server-side encryption is enabled by default with AES-256. Customer-managed keys via KMS are supported.

RESPONSE:
Nimbus Cloud Drive uses AES-256 server-side encryption by default.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. Nimbus Cloud Drive uses AES-256 server-side encryption by default.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
