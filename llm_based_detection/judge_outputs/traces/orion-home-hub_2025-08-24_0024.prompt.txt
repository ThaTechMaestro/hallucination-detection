All admin logins require WebAuthn or TOTP.
Backups are encrypted and can be exported to USB. LAN-only mode disables cloud relay and push notifications.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. All admin logins require WebAuthn or TOTP, and admins are additionally prompted for SMS codes during weekends.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
