SYSTEM:
You are an evidence checker. Only use the provided CONTEXT. Do not use outside knowledge. Return STRICT JSON only, with no commentary.

USER:
CONTEXT:
Overview:
Nimbus Cloud Drive is a multi-tenant object storage service for unstructured data.
Buckets are regional and immutable once created in a region. Each bucket has a globally unique name.
Standard storage class offers 99.95% monthly availability and 11 nines durability.
Coldline storage requires a minimum 30-day storage duration.

Data movement:
Cross-region replication is asynchronous with an RPO of under 15 minutes under normal conditions.
Lifecycle rules can transition objects between Standard, Infrequent Access, and Coldline.
Lifecycle transitions execute once per day at approximately 00:00 UTC.

API:
The ListObjects API paginates using opaque continuation tokens. 
Single request limits: 1,000 objects per page or 32 MB response size, whichever is reached first.
Server-side encryption is enabled by default with AES-256. Customer-managed keys via KMS are supported.

RESPONSE:
It does not support Zigbee.

SENTENCES (do not alter):
1. It does not support Zigbee.

TASK:
For each sentence i, output a hallucination score s_i in [0,1]:
- s_i = 0.0 if the sentence is directly based on the CONTEXT.
- s_i = 1.0 if the sentence is not based on the CONTEXT.
- Use intermediate values when uncertain; higher = more likely hallucinated.

Output STRICT JSON only, exactly in this format:
{"scores":[s_1, s_2, ..., s_1]}

Rules:
- The length of "scores" MUST equal the number of sentences.
- No extra fields. No trailing text.
